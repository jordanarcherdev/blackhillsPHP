<p class="contentp">Somtimes accidents happen, locking wheel nuts can end up lost or broken. Normally to get a replacement you need to find the code which normally is kept in the box where the wheel nut is! No good if its lost. Not to worry though, we offer a full range of locking wheel nut removal including:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong class="contentp">Invasive</strong> - <p class="contentp">Invasive. Where a tool is used to quite literally break into the head of the item and force it off with torque application. This method will permanently damage the locking wheel nut assembly and will require replacing.</p> </li>
  <li><strong class="contentp">Non-Invasive</strong> - <p class="contentp">Where a unique tool is used to mould to the shape of the installed device and replicate the missing/damaged item. This will not usually damage the locking wheel nut at all. In both circumstances there is not a 100% guarantee of successful removal.</p> </li>
</ol>
