<h2 class="center-title">Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS)</h2>
<br>
<p class="contentp">All cars manufactured from <strong>2014</strong> have <strong>TPMS</strong> fitted as standard.<br><br>
As from <strong>January 2015</strong> if your TPMS light is on this will result in an <strong class="red">MOT failure</strong>. In order to prevent this, it is reccomended to have your sensor valves serviced regularly preventing sensor failure.<br><br>
We can now help if you require your sensors to be serviced or replaced.<br><br>
We can even clone the ones on your car to create a new set for your winter wheels.<br><br>
All this at a fraction of the dealers price why not give us a call and see if we can help? </p>
